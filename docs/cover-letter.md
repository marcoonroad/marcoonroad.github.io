Dear recruiters,

I’m a software developer looking for new opportunities and challenges. My birthplace and current location is based on Rio de Janeiro city - Brazil, I have no choice but work at this city in the moment – yet with enough remote work experience and possibly making business trips on closer cities.

On my first project we have made a partnership with Ethereum Foundation Brazil, using Type Theory and Dependent Types on an applied research for Blockchain’s Smart Contracts. The goal was to make Blockchain applications safer against security breaches exploitable by malicious agents.

On my second project we have developed an Open Banking API from scratch, using Hexagonal Architecture for services integration, besides Domain Driven Design and CQRS/ES on implementation-level. Everything targeting seamless scalability and a cloud native application.

Finally, on my second job I have become a complete developer, with exeperience on development of websites and mobile applications. Here I have become skilled on business knowledges, mostly on financial and marketing fields. We migrated a Loyalty & Rewards legacy application into a complete CRM system (for shopping center’s retail network), also working on embedded graphical reports for marketing administrators. We have applied Data Science for base cut (by persona) and channel selection (e-mail, push notifications, SMS and in-app banners) with the goal to optimize our automated marketing campaign’s costs & conversions (‘cause spam has low engagement and burns money). Our mission was to make the retail “smart” in the same sense of e-commerce.

Regarding marketing and mobile development tools, I have prior experience with Google Analytics & Crashlytics, Firebase, generating reports with SQL queries, data visualization with D3.js and Google Charts, besides OneSignal API for push notifications.

Along these years, I always valued teamwork, collaboration and “know-how” sharing. I have experience mentoring coworkers and using pair-programming.

I kindly hope you all have interest on my background.

<br/>
<br/>

Best regards, Marco A. da Silva
